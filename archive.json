Many would prefer to use meetecho for this, but then there was push back that said if it used the official tool, then it would be a BOF.\nIf the reason to limit BOFs to <= 2 is due to time constraints for plenary week, then any time elsewhere (elsewhen?) should not count.\nIf there are other reasons to limit BOF, then they should be enumerated.\n\nThere is also now an IAB involvement in bringing new work.\n\nreplacing ietf-wg-procon/2026bis#19, and this issue should move to other repo.\n",
